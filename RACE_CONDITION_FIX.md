# Race Condition Fix: Duplicate Payment Prevention

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: Race condition in payment creation allowed duplicate payments for the same blockchain transaction.

**Root Cause**: The "check-then-act" pattern in `createPaymentFromFrontend()`:

```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE CODE (Before Fix)
const existingPayment = await this.findByTxSignature(dto.txSignature, dto.chain);
if (existingPayment) {
  throw new ConflictException('Payment already exists');
}
// ... create payment
```

**Attack Scenario**:
1. User submits payment form
2. Network glitch causes frontend to retry the request
3. Both requests pass the duplicate check simultaneously
4. Two identical payment records are created in the database
5. Merchant gets double-charged or payment count is incorrect

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database-Level Unique Constraint

Added a **unique compound index** on `{txSignature, chain}` in the MongoDB schema.

**File**: [`src/payments/schemas/payments.schema.ts`](src/payments/schemas/payments.schema.ts)

```typescript
// Unique compound index to prevent duplicate payments
PaymentSchema.index({ txSignature: 1, chain: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

**Why this works**:
- MongoDB enforces uniqueness at the database level
- Even if 1000 concurrent requests arrive, only ONE can succeed
- Atomic operation - no race condition possible
- Works across multiple server instances (horizontal scaling)

### 2. Graceful Error Handling

Updated the service to handle duplicate key errors gracefully.

**File**: [`src/payments/payments.service.ts`](src/payments/payments.service.ts)

```typescript
try {
  payment = await this.createPayment({ ... });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle duplicate key error from MongoDB unique index
  if (error.code === 11000 || error.name === 'MongoServerError') {
    this.logger.warn(`Duplicate payment attempt for tx ${dto.txSignature}`);
    // Return the existing payment instead of throwing error
    const existingPayment = await this.findByTxSignature(dto.txSignature, dto.chain);
    if (existingPayment) {
      return existingPayment;
    }
  }
  throw error;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents duplicates at database level
- ✅ Returns existing payment for duplicate requests (idempotent)
- ✅ Frontend can safely retry without creating duplicates
- ✅ Works with horizontal scaling (multiple server instances)
- ✅ No application-level coordination needed

   - Migration script to add the unique index to existing database
   - Checks for existing duplicates before adding constraint
   - Reports any duplicate payments that need cleanup

4. **[scripts/test-duplicate-payment-prevention.js](scripts/test-duplicate-payment-prevention.js)**
   - Test script to verify the fix works correctly
   - Simulates race conditions with concurrent requests
   - Validates that only one payment is created

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Check for Existing Duplicates

Before deploying, check if there are any existing duplicate payments:

```bash
# Run the migration script in check-only mode
node scripts/add-unique-payment-index.js
```

If duplicates are found, you'll need to clean them up manually before proceeding.

### Step 2: Add the Unique Index

Run the migration script to add the unique index:

```bash
node scripts/add-unique-payment-index.js
```

**Expected output**:
```
✅ No duplicate payments found
📝 Creating unique index on {txSignature, chain}...
✅ Unique index created successfully!
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix

Run the test script to verify the fix works:

```bash
node scripts/test-duplicate-payment-prevention.js
```

**Expected output**:
```
Test 1: Inserting first payment...
✅ First payment inserted successfully

Test 2: Attempting to insert duplicate payment...
✅ Duplicate payment correctly rejected (Error code: 11000)

Test 3: Simulating race condition with 5 concurrent requests...
   Results: 1 succeeded, 4 rejected
✅ Race condition handled correctly - only 1 payment created

🎉 All tests passed!
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Code

Deploy the updated code to your server:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to production
npm run start:prod
```

### Step 5: Verify in Production

Monitor your logs for the first few minutes after deployment:

```bash
# Look for duplicate payment warnings (should be rare now)
grep "Duplicate payment attempt" logs/application.log
```

## Testing Locally

### Manual Testing

You can manually test by sending duplicate payment requests:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Send first request
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "linkCode": "your_link_code",
    "txSignature": "test_tx_123",
    "chain": "solana",
    "amount": 100,
    "token": "USDC",
    "fromAddress": "from_wallet",
    "toAddress": "to_wallet"
  }'

# Terminal 2: Immediately send duplicate request
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "linkCode": "your_link_code",
    "txSignature": "test_tx_123",
    "chain": "solana",
    "amount": 100,
    "token": "USDC",
    "fromAddress": "from_wallet",
    "toAddress": "to_wallet"
  }'
```

**Expected behavior**: Both requests succeed (one creates, one returns existing), but only ONE payment record exists in the database.

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- ✅ Fast read operation (check for duplicate)
- ❌ Race condition vulnerability
- ❌ Not safe for concurrent requests

### After Fix
- ✅ Same performance (unique index is fast)
- ✅ No race condition
- ✅ Safe for concurrent requests
- ✅ Works with horizontal scaling

**Index overhead**: Minimal - unique indexes in MongoDB are highly optimized and add negligible overhead.

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also prevents issues with:

1. **Network retries**: Frontend can safely retry failed requests
2. **Double-click submissions**: Users accidentally clicking "Pay" twice
3. **Webhook retries**: External systems can safely retry webhook deliveries
4. **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple server instances won't create duplicates
5. **Transaction monitoring**: Blockchain monitors won't create duplicate payments

---

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add Transaction Verification (High Priority)

Currently, the system trusts client-provided transaction data. Consider adding on-chain verification:

```typescript
// Before creating payment, verify the transaction on-chain
const onChainTx = await this.solanaService.getTransaction(dto.txSignature);
if (!onChainTx) {
  throw new BadRequestException('Transaction not found on blockchain');
}

// Verify amount, recipient, etc.
if (onChainTx.amount !== dto.amount) {
  throw new BadRequestException('Transaction amount mismatch');
}
```

### 2. Add Request Idempotency Keys

For additional safety, consider adding idempotency keys:

```typescript
@Post('payments')
async createPayment(
  @Body() dto: CreatePaymentDto,
  @Header('Idempotency-Key') idempotencyKey?: string
) {
  // Use idempotency key to prevent duplicates at API level
}
```

### 3. Monitor for Duplicate Attempts

Set up alerting for frequent duplicate attempts (might indicate attacks):

```typescript
if (error.code === 11000) {
  this.metricsService.incrementCounter('duplicate_payment_attempts');
  // Alert if rate > threshold
}
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Keep the index**: The unique index is safe and should stay
2. **Revert code changes**: You can revert the service changes if needed
3. **The old check is redundant**: The database index provides better protection

To remove the index (not recommended):

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
db.payments.dropIndex('txSignature_chain_unique');
```

---

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check MongoDB logs for index creation errors
2. Verify the index exists: `db.payments.getIndexes()`
3. Run the test script to validate behavior
4. Check application logs for duplicate key errors
